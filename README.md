 # Let's take a dive! :woman_technologist: :blue_heart: 

In the class Projet Num√©rique focused on working with python to solve physics problems.

We had a final projet about diving and here you can see the code that helped us to represent the experiment and do the calculations.

Even with a basic project like this we can start to understand the impact of computer science in the physic field, how it can be used to help us to solve problems and process data.
