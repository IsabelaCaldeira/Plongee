 # Let's take a dive! :woman_technologist: :blue_heart: 

In the class called projet num√©rique it was focused in working with python to solve physics problems.

Here is the final projet that I chosed, it means diving and it's about using the code to help us in working with problem and find a good way to represent to experience.

It was a really cool to find how codes can help us with physic, even with a basic project like that we can start to understand to impact of computer science in the physic field.
